in 99% of cases server side server address should be set to 0.0.0.0\
server side will also throw errors sometimes, could probably find out why but that's a lot of work, and it seems to work fine

typing quit in the client side will quit the process

## Requirements

this requires colorama to display colors on the client side, no requirements for server side besides python3\
use `pip install colorama` to install
